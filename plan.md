# ðŸ“Š AI-Powered Data Insight Platform

**Project Lead:** Vaibhav Mahindru  
**Start Date:** April 05, 2025  
**Goal:** Build a Streamlit-based AI web app where users can upload Excel files and receive detailed AI-generated summaries, insights, and dynamic, interactive graphs â€” with user authentication.

## ðŸ§­ Master Roadmap

| Phase | Title | Description | Tools |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **Basic Project Setup + MVP UI** | Upload Excel/CSV, preview file, basic data summary | `streamlit`, `pandas` |
| 2 | **AI Summary with DeepSeek** | Call DeepSeek API to generate detailed natural-language summary | `requests`, DeepSeek API |
| 3 | **AI-Generated Graph Code** | Ask AI to generate Python code to visualize data | `json`, prompt design |
| 4 | **Run AI Graph Code** | Execute AI-generated code to render visuals dynamically | `exec()`, `matplotlib`, `plotly` |
| 5 | **Interactive Dashboard** | Add filters, dropdowns, and interactive graphs | `plotly`, `streamlit widgets` |
| 6 | **Advanced AI Insights** | AI points out anomalies, trends, suggestions | Gemini prompts, NLP |
| 6.5 | **Modularity** | Making code more odular and clean. Deploying the MVP | Streamlit |
| 7 | **User Authentication System** | Register/Login, private workspaces | `streamlit-authenticator`, `session_state` |
| 8 | **Chat with Your Data** | Users can ask questions about their uploaded data | DeepSeek LLM, `pandas` |
| 9 | **User History + Logging** | Track uploads & results by user | `uuid`, `yaml`, `logging` |
| 10 | **Deployment** | Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or Render | `requirements.txt`, `GitHub` |
| 11 | **Bonus Features** | Export to PDF, download dashboard, voice replies | `pdfkit`, TTS APIs |
